                    <p>No, you don’t. All you need is a cryptocurrency wallet to store your NGNT. We recommend <a href="https://trustwallet.com/">Trust Wallet</a> for mobile devices and <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> for desktop browsers.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-h3">What is NGNT? </h3>
                    <p>NGNT is a token that’s fiat-backed with real Naira held in licensed financial institutions (banks). Unlike most volatile digital currencies, NGNT is pegged 1:1 against the Naira. This means that for every NGNT out there on the network, there is an equivalent Naira amount held securely in bank accounts. You can learn more about it at <a href="https://ngnt.org">ngnt.org</a>.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-h3">How to redeem NGNT for Naira? </h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to redeem your NGNT for Naira, you will need to send it to a wallet that supports withdrawals of Naira from NGNT. 
                        Such a wallet will collect your NGNT and send Naira to your chosen bank account.
